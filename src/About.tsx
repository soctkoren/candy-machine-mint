            <p _ngcontent-qcw-c38=""><span _ngcontent-qcw-c38="" className="pink">Not Larva Labs</span> is now the official home for <span _ngcontent-qcw-c38="" className="pink">CryptoPhunks</span>.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-qcw-c38="">We've created a <span _ngcontent-qcw-c38="" className="pink">royalty-free marketplace</span> where users can finally buy and sell <span _ngcontent-qcw-c38="" className="pink">CryptoPhunks</span> with ease. Launched in June of 2021, CryptoPhunks has been delisted from OpenSea on three separate occasions and is the first NFT project to receive an official DMCA notice from <span _ngcontent-qcw-c38="" className="pink">Larva Labs</span>.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-qcw-c38="">Currently, we are witnessing web2 copyright laws unilaterally applied in a web3 world where true <span _ngcontent-qcw-c38="" className="pink">decentralization</span> and <span _ngcontent-qcw-c38="" className="pink">provenance</span> should be paramount. We believe it is our duty to stand up to <span _ngcontent-qcw-c38="" className="pink">censorship</span> and safeguard our <span _ngcontent-qcw-c38="" className="pink">freedom of expression</span>, if we ever wish to have any.</p><p _ngcontent-qcw-c38="">All art is <span _ngcontent-qcw-c38="" className="pink">derivative</span>. Therefore, all art should be <span _ngcontent-qcw-c38="" className="pink">open-source</span> and free for all to use, remix, and transform. For a true <span _ngcontent-qcw-c38="" className="pink">digital renaissance</span> to materialize, our creativity must be unbridled and limitless.</p><p _ngcontent-qcw-c38="">Simply put, we exist to upset and challenge the archaic boundary makers of the <span _ngcontent-qcw-c38="" className="pink">old paradigm</span>, to bring forth new ideas, new art, new technologies, and to usher in a <span _ngcontent-qcw-c38="" className="pink">new world</span>.</p>
